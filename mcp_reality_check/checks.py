"""Heuristic checks run against one successful tool response.

Deliberately not LLM-judged (see README for why) — every check here is a
plain, deterministic rule, in the same spirit as mcp-doctor and mcp-fuzz:
no network calls beyond the one to the target server, no API key, fully
reproducible. That means real recall limits (a refusal phrased in a way the
pattern list doesn't cover won't be caught) in exchange for zero cost and
zero flakiness — a deliberate tradeoff, not an oversight.

Checks are split the same way mcp-fuzz splits crashes from "valid_call_
errored": REFUSAL_IN_DISGUISE and EMPTY_CONTENT are confident enough to
score. ECHO_MISMATCH is a weaker signal (a real, on-topic answer may
legitimately not repeat the input back verbatim) and is reported
separately, flagged as worth a manual look rather than folded into the
score — the same "don't overclaim a heuristic" discipline used throughout
this family of tools.
