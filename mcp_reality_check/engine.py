"""Connects to a real, running MCP server — over stdio (a launched local
command) or Streamable HTTP (a remote URL) — calls each tool once with
realistic-looking valid arguments, and checks whether the response is a
genuine answer — not just structurally well-formed.

mcp-doctor reads a server's source and never runs it. mcp-fuzz runs it, but
only judges the *bad*-input path (does it crash?) — it explicitly declines
to judge a *successful* call's content, since a schema-only placeholder
value usually isn't realistic enough to fairly judge correctness. This
tool is the piece that was missing: still fully deterministic, still no
LLM, no API key, no per-call cost — just closer-to-realistic input plus a
handful of reliable content checks (a disguised refusal, empty content, a
declared output schema the response doesn't actually match).

Safety: same default as mcp-fuzz — only `readOnlyHint: true` tools are
called unless `--include-destructive` is passed. This tool executes real
tool calls; it inherits that risk from the target server exactly the same
way mcp-fuzz does.
