"""Runtime counterpart to the batch audit in `engine.py`: applies the same
deterministic content checks to one real tool call an agent actually makes,
instead of one synthetic call per tool in a one-shot report.

Where this differs from `engine.py`: that module connects to a server itself
and calls every tool once with realistic-*looking* generated arguments, to
produce a report. `guarded_call` doesn't connect to anything — it wraps a
call an agent's own `ClientSession` was already going to make, with the
agent's own real arguments, and checks the real response. Same checks
module, same no-LLM/no-API-key/zero-cost guarantee, different call site:
audit time vs. call time.

This is deliberately narrow: it answers "is this response real" (a
disguised refusal, empty content, a declared output schema the response
doesn't match), not "is this response safe" (secrets, prompt injection,
destructive actions) — that's a different, already well-served problem.
See README for the reasoning.
